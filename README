WorldGuardListener
by CoderJCronin

DeadboltGuard was a CraftBukkit plugin that works to resolve an issue with
DeadBolt ignoring WorldGuard permissions when quick-placing a sign (issue #44:
Bypasses WorldGuard @ https://github.com/daemitus/Deadbolt/issues/44).

DeadboltGuard is now WorldGuardListener; simply extract WorldGuardListener.class
from the jar and drop it in the "listeners" folder of Deadbolt's plugin folder.

Sorry for the delay and hack first release; for some reason relase Deadbolt is
a lot different from the source (source references DeadboltPlugin, release merged
this Deadbolt... other oddities).
