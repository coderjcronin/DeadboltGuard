DeadboltGuard
by CoderJCronin

DeadboltGuard is a CraftBukkit plugin that works to resolve an issue with
DeadBolt ignoring WorldGuard permissions when quick-placing a sign (issue #44:
Bypasses WorldGuard @ https://github.com/daemitus/Deadbolt/issues/44).

DeadboltGuard hooks the PlayerInteractEvent to see if the player is holding a
sign and if they have permission to build (or rather, lack of permission). If 
both checks are met and the event hasn't been cancelled already, the plugin
cancels the sign placement and throws the Deadbolt error for modifying the
chest.

No configuration is necessary, just drop DeadBoltGuard.jar in the plugins
folder and you are off to the races. Obviously, this plugin will not load
if WorldGuard and Deadbolt are not also enabled.
